Hello Im Acid the creator of this script, . This script is being made because in my server we have park patterns and use DD-EXTRACONTROLS 
inorder to allow leo to have full control of their vehicles. The downside to this is when you take vehicle damage you car auto fixes or 
when you toggle the extra with a keybind it repairs your vehicle'

***How To Install***
very simple install just drag and drop into your server resources and start it in your server.cfg.

if you have your folders are named like this [basescripts] or in any other configuration like this 
you can just drag and drop into the folder and keep moving.

Both of these methods require you to restart the server in order to allow the script to start 

if you dont wanna restart your server simply type /refresh and /start Acd-DisableExtraRepair in to your server's chat

***Features***
This script stops other scripts such as parkpattern and DD_EXTRACONTROL from fixing you vehicle everytime you stop
or toggle a extra.

In order to equip extras ingame with this script enabled you must equip the extras you want then repair your vehicle for them to show.
