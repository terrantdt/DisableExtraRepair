description 'This resource will disable the ability to repair vehicles when enabling an extra. This script is being made because in my server we have park patterns and use DD-EXTRACONTROLS inorder to allow leo to have full control of their vehicles. The downside to this is when you take vehicle damage you car auto fixes or when you toggle the extra with a keybind it repairs your vehicle'
